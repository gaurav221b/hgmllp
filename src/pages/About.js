                        Hrishikesh Gawali is a qualified chartered accountant. Rather than joining a big organisation and being a small part of it, he decided to start his own and grow it with time. He gained a wide range of taxation, consulting, statutory audits, and internal auditing experience during his three-year articleship. As a result of his innovative solutions, strategic thinking, and work ethic, he built trust with his clients, ranging from individuals to corporations. His interests extend to management consulting and project financing, in addition to direct taxation and auditing. Since he believes that blockchain will be the future, he is keenly interested in digital assets. Besides it, he is also passionate about real estate. As a result of his interest in these areas, he keeps up-to-date on those areas.
